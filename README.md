# JTS-HW4-Pandas

This weekâ€™s assignment finds us using Pandas library with Jupyter Notebook as its interface.  The extensive use of dataframes allow the budding Data Scientist to manipulate and extract data based on series within the dataset.  The homework asked us to analyzing city school data or sales data of a video game.  The Heroes of Pymoli assignment asked us to get a total count of unique players.  It asked to analyze data grouped by gender of players and purchasing.  We also created subgroups based on age to look at player counts and purchasing trends.  Finally, we created charts to view most popular based on purchase count and most profitable based on total purchase value.


Trend #1
Males make up the overwhelming percentage of players for this videogame.  More than four out of five players who play this game identify as male.

Trend #2
The age group that dominates the stats is the 20 to 24 range.  At around 45%, it is almost as much as the next 4 age groups combined.

Trend #3
Across the age groups, the average number of Purchases per person has a mean of 1.30, median of 1.31 and standard deviation of .10.  Although the other numbers per age group are lopsided.  The average purchase per person is steady at about 1.3.
